# Project #2 Patio Cafe - SuperHi Foundations Course

A beautiful single page website for a hypothetical cafe. You can view it [Here](https://patio-cafe-499.superhi.hosting/)

Some of the new concepts I learned while doing this project were;

1. Modifying `background-image` to repeat
2. Leveraging Semantic HTML in code
3. When and how to use margin/padding
4. Box model of CSS
5. `line-height` in CSS
6. Why classes are a better way of selecting HTML elements
7. I also learned a new tag called `<blockquote>`

That's not all, the course instructor Lawrence also explained responsive design principles and gave a little taste in using media queries to conditionally apply styles to various screen widths.
